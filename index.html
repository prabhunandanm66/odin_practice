        While cake colis, make crumb topping. Put cookies in a large zip-top
        bag, seal bag, and use a rliling pin to crush cookies into coarse
        crumbs. Transfer crumbs to a small bowl. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons
        melted butter and dash of salt.
      </li>

        For caramel glaze, melt the 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over

        occasionally, until mixture begins to boil. Add milk and bring to a
        simmer. Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar and remaining 1
        teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt until completely smooth.

      <li>
        Spread hot glaze in an even layer over cake. Immediately sprinkle with
        crumb topping. Let cake stand at room temperature until glaze sets,
        about 15 minutes.
